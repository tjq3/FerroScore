\title{Calculate Ferroptosis Score for Single Samples}
\usage{
calculate_ferroptosis_score(
  counts_data,
  sample_name,
  control_cols,
  treated_cols,
  species = "mouse",
  ppi_file = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts_data}{A matrix or data frame of raw counts with genes as rows and samples as columns.}

\item{sample_name}{Character string specifying the sample name being analyzed.}

\item{control_cols}{Numeric vector specifying the columns of control samples.}

\item{treated_cols}{Numeric vector specifying the columns of treated samples.}

\item{species}{Character string specifying the species, either "mouse" or "human".}

\item{ppi_file}{Path to the PPI network file (STRING database format).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item sample_name: The analyzed sample name
  \item DEG_results: Data frame of differential expression results
  \item iron_metabolism: Score for iron-related modules
  \item lipid_metabolism: Score for lipid-related modules
  \item gsh_metabolism: Score for glutathione-related modules
  \item ferroptosis_score: Composite ferroptosis score
}
}
\description{
This function performs differential expression analysis, constructs protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks,
identifies functional modules, and calculates a ferroptosis score based on iron, lipid, and glutathione metabolism.
